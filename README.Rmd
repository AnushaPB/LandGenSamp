## 1. Main Pipeline

I have tried to create a complete list of files in all of the directories and what they are for, but I am a fallible human being, so shoot me an email if I have missed anything or you have questions (anusha.bishop@berkeley.edu).

*Note that most of the scripts are parallelized* 

### 1.1 [p1_simulations](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p1_gnxsims)
Run [geonomics](https://geonomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulations

```
[p1_gnxsims]
|
└───[MNLM]
│   │   create_MNLM.R - create NLMs for gnx simulations
│   │   view_MNLM.Rmd - view NLMs created by create_MNLM.R
|   |   
│   └───[layers] - directory with NLM csvs (used to create landscapes for gnx simulations)
|   
└───[gnx]
    │   create_genomic_architecture.R - create genomic architecture file for gnx simulations
    │   genomic_architecture.csv - genomic architecture file created by create_genomic_architecture.R
    │   parallel_LGS.py - run geonomics simulations
    │   data_cleanup.sh - run after parallel_LGS.py to clean up and reorganize the files
    │   run_make_dosage.R - run after data_cleanup.sh to create dosage matrices from simulation vcf files
    │   
    └───[LGS data] - directory created by data_cleanup.sh and filled with simulation results from parallel_LGS.py
```

### 1.2 [p2_sampling](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p2_sampling)
Generate datasets for different sampling strategies

```
[p2_sampling]
|   sampling_job.sh - bash script to create sampling datasets
|   sampling_functions.R - functions used to create different sampling schemes
|   {sampling scheme}_{ind/sitesampling}.R - all files following this pattern are used to create sampling datasets 
|   
└───[outputs] - directory for storing sampling outputs
```

### 1.3 [p3_methods](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p3_methods)
Test different landscape genomic analyses

```
[p3_methods]
|   methods_job.sh - bash script to run landscape genomic methods and calculate summary stats for simulation results
|   general_run_functions.R - functions used for running landscape genomic methods
|   GEA_functions.R - functions used to run GEA analyses
|   IBDIBE_functions.R - functions used to run IBD/IBE analyses
|   run_methods.R - script to run all analyses (run by methods_job.sh)
|   popsize_counts.R - script to calculate population size for all simulations (run by methods_job.sh)
|   phenotype_mismatch.R - script to calculate phenotypic mismatch (run by methods_job.sh)
|  
└───[outputs] - directory for storing methods outputs
```

### 1.4 [p4_analysis](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p4_analysis)
Analyze and visualize landscape genomic results 

```
[p4_analysis]
|   analysis_functions.R - functions used for running summary analyses
|   analysis_GEA.Rmd - notebook for running and visualizing summary analyses for GEA methods (File S2)
|   analysis_IBDIBE.Rmd - notebook for running and visualizing summary analyses for IBD/IBE methods (File S3)
|   analysis_simulations.Rmd - notebook for visualizing summary statistics for simulations
|   analysis_megatable.Rmd - notebook for creating giant tables of mixed model results
|   example_simulations.Rmd - notebook used to visualize example simulations for Figure 1
|  
└───[outputs] - directory for storing analysis outputs
|  
└───[example_data] - directory for storing example data used by example_simulations.Rmd
```

## To run everything:

```bash
# Create MNLMs
Rscript p1_gnxims/MNLM/create_MNLM.R
# The generated MNLMs can be visualized with the p1_gnxsims/MNLM/view_MNLM.Rmd notebook

# Run gnx simulations
cd p1_gnxsims/gnx
## Create genomic architecture for gnx simulations
Rscript create_genomic_architecture.R
## Run simulations (note: this takes several weeks and is parallelized)
## contact anusha.bishop@berkeley.edu if you would like the simulation results
python3 parallel_LGS.py

# Create subsampled datasets
cd ../p2_gnxsims
bash sampling_job.sh

# Run landscape genomic methods
cd ../p3_methods
bash methods_job.sh

# Results can be visualized with the Rmd notebooks in the p4_analysis folder
```
