## 1. Files

I have tried to create a complete list of files in all of the directories and what they are for, but shoot me an email if I have missed anything or you have questions (anusha.bishop@berkeley.edu).

Software versions:

- Ubuntu 20.04.6

- R 4.3.0

- Python 3.9.7

[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) was used to manage R package dependencies. If you clone this repository and open the project (i.e., the .Rproj file), renv will automatically start up and ask you if you want to install all the required packages by running `renv::restore()`. 

*Note: most of the scripts are parallelized and written to run on 10-25 processors with 126 GB RAM* 

### 1.1 [p1_simulations](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p1_gnxsims)
Run [geonomics](https://geonomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulations

```
[p1_gnxsims]
|   p1_gnxsims_job.sh - bash script to create MNLMs and run geonomics simulations
|
└───[MNLM]
│   │   create_MNLM.R - create NLMs for gnx simulations (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
│   │   view_MNLM.Rmd - view NLMs created by create_MNLM.R
│   │   File_S2.Rmd - generate environmental correlation distributions, rendered as .html and converted to PDF (rendered by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
|   |   
│   └───[layers] - directory with NLM csvs (used to create landscapes for gnx simulations)
|   
└───[gnx]
    │   conda_create.sh - create conda environment for gnx simulations from gnx.yml (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
    │   create_genomic_architecture.R - create genomic architecture file for gnx simulations (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
    │   FileS3_gnx_parameters.py - supplementary file of gnx parameters
    │   genomic_architecture.csv - genomic architecture file created by create_genomic_architecture.R
    │   gnx.yml - conda yml used to create conda environment (see conda_create.sh)
    │   run_gnx.py - run geonomics simulations (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
    │   data_cleanup.sh - run after parallel_LGS.py to clean up and reorganize the files (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
    │   run_make_dosage.R - run after data_cleanup.sh to create dosage matrices from simulation vcf files (run by p1_gnxsims_job.sh)
    │   
    └───[LGS data] - directory created by data_cleanup.sh and filled with simulation results from parallel_LGS.py
```

### 1.2 [p2_sampling](https://github.com/AnushaPB/LandGenSamp/tree/main/p2_sampling)
Generate datasets for different sampling strategies

```
[p2_sampling]
