#code to create a genomic architecture file
library(here)
#from gnx docs:
#CSV file with loci as rows and ‘locus’, ‘p’, ‘dom’, ‘r’, ‘trait’, and ‘alpha’ as columns 
#stipulating the locus numbers, starting allele frequencies, dominance values, inter-locus recombination rates, trait names, 
#and effect sizes of all loci; values can be left blank if not applicable).

#total number of loci
nloci <- 10000

#create data frame
df <- data.frame(locus = 0:(nloci-1),
           p = 0.5,

           alpha = NA)

#change first r value to 0 (required by gnx - see docs)
df$r[1] <- 0

#specify which loci belong to which traits
#in this case there are two traits, each with 4 loci
#their location does not matter because there is no linkage
df$trait[1:4] <- "trait_1"
df$trait[5:8] <- "trait_2"
#set alpha for trait related loci to cover phenotype spectrum
df$alpha[1:8] <- 0.25

#IMPORTANT NOTE: because of the python indexing, the loci will be 0:3 for trait 1 and 4:7 for trait 2
#I have accounted for this in the rest of the R code

#write out file
